title: "Metabolic Pathway Prediction of Enzymes for Plant"
---

Based on machine learning approach, this tool is use to predict metabolic pathway of enzymes.
<br>

### Tutorial

To use mAppLe tool, you will need:

- OS Linux (tested with Ubuntu 18.04)
- R 3.6.0 or higher
- Memory RAM: 8GB or higher
